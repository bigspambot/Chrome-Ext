# Chrome-Ext
 
## This is my Bookmarks Extension!

##### You can add a bookmark by typing it to the input field and clicking **SAVE INPUT**.

To save the current tab, click **SAVE TAB**.

Double clicking **DELETE ALL** deletes the notes.

##### Possible Improvements

- Add notes instead of links that render as text (Without *a* tags)

- Be able to delete individual entries or just the latest one (as though undoing)

##### Skills Demonstrated

- const
- event listeners
- innerHTML
- input.value
- function parameters
- template strings (using `` and ${variableName})
- localStorage (setItem, getItem, clear)
- JSON stringify/parse/manifest file
- objects in arrays
